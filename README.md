# WeightPrediction

'Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it' (Coursera, 2017). In this project, we use a Weight Lifting Exercises dataset from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to 'investigate "how (well)" an activity was performed by the wearer' (Ugulino et.al, 2012).
